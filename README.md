## BurgerBot

I was frustrated with the lack of available slots in Burgeramt, so I've created this bot for myself, to catch one that available. It's pretty straightforward, once per 30 seconds it parses page with all appointments in all Berlin Burgeramts and if there is available slot for current and next month - it notifies in telegram with the link to registration.

# Update

I've shut down burgerbot in 2023 due to changes in the burgeramt website and it's lowered limits. https://allaboutberlin.com/ has good implementation of bot and I suggest either to use that or to fork this repo and continue yourself.
